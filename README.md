# Reinforcement Learning and Its Application on a Board Game Connect4

This repository serves as an introductory project on the topic of Reinforcement Learning. It features the implementation of Q-learning applied to the board game Connect Four, as part of the 2023-2024 Spring thesis project. The game is played between a human and a computer, where the program takes any available move from the user as input. The computer's moves are based on a saved policy, trained using the Q-learning algorithm, which aims to maximize overall rewards.

Note: A new version has been added to the repository. In this version, two computers play against each other, with both following the same policy, trained using the Q-learning algorithm.
